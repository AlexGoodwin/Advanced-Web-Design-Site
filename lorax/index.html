			<h1>The Lorax</h1>
			<p id="author">- by Dr. Suess -</p>
			
			<img src="img/lorax.png" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
			
			<!-- story -->		
			<p>At the far end of town<br>
where the Grickle-grass grows<br>
and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows<br>
and no birds ever sing excepting old crows...<br>
is the Street of the Lifted Lorax.</p>
			<p>And deep in the Grickle-grass, some people say,<br>
if you look deep enough you can still see, today,<br>
where the Lorax once stood<br>
just as long as it could<br>
before somebody lifted the Lorax away.</p>
			<p>What was the Lorax?<br>
And why was it there?<br>
And why was it lifted and taken somewhere<br>
from the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows?</p>
			<p>The old Once-ler still lives here.<br>
Ask him. He knows.</p>
			<p>You won't see the Once-ler.<br>
Don't knock at his door.</p>
			<p>He stays in his Lerkim on top of his store.<br>
He lurks in his Lerkim, cold under the roof,<br>
where he makes his own clothes<br>
out of miff-muffered moof.</p>
			<p>And on special dank midnights in August,<br>
he peeks out of the shutters<br>
and sometimes he speaks<br>
and tells how the Lorax was lifted away.</p>
			<p>He'll tell you, perhaps...<br>
if you're willing to pay.</p>

			<p>On the end of a rope<br>
he lets down a tin pail<br>
and you have to toss in fifteen cents<br>
and a nail<br>
and the shell of a great-great-great-<br>
grandfather snail.</p>
			<p>Then he pulls up the pail,<br>
makes a most careful count<br>
to see if you've paid him<br>
the proper amount.</p>
			<p>Then he hides what you paid him<br>
away in his Snuvv,<br>
his secret strange hole<br>
in his gruvvulous glove.</p>
			<p>Then he grunts, "I will call you by Whisper-ma-Phone,<br>
for the secrets I tell you are for your ears alone." </p>
			<p id="slup">SLUPP!</p>
			<p>Down slupps the Whisper-ma-Phone to your ear<br>
and the old Once-ler's whispers are not very clear,<br>
since they have to come down<br>
through a snergelly hose,<br>
and he sounds<br>
as if he had<br>
smallish bees up his nose.</p>
			<p>"Now I'll tell you,"<br>
			he says, with his teeth sounding gray,<br>
"how the Lorax got lifted and taken away..."</p>

	<p>It all started way back...<br>
such a long, long time back...</p>
	<p>Way back in the days when the grass was still green<br>
and the pond was still wet<br>
and the clouds were still clean,<br>
and the song of the Swomee-Swans rang out in space...</p>
	<p>one morning, I came to this glorious place.<br>
And I first saw the trees!<br>
The Truffula Trees!<br>
The bright-colored tufts of the Truffula Trees!</p>
	<p>Mile after mile in the fresh morning breeze.<br>
And, under the trees, I saw Brown Bar-ba-loots<br>
frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits<br>
as they played in the shade and ate Truffula fruits.</p>
	<p>From the rippulous pond<br>
came the comfortable sound<br>
of the Humming-Fish humming<br>
while splashing around.</p>

	<p>But those trees! Those trees!<br>
Those Truffula Trees!<br>
All my life I'd been searching<br>
for trees such as these.</p>
	<p>The touch of their tufts<br>
was much softer than silk.<br>
And they had the sweet smell<br>
of fresh butterfly milk.</p>
	<p>I felt a great leaping<br>
of joy in my heart.<br>
I knew just what I'd do!<br>
I unloaded my cart.</p>
	<p>In no time at all, I had built a small shop.<br>
Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree with one chop.</p>
	<p>And with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed,<br>
I took the soft tuft, and I knitted a Thneed!<br>
The instant I'd finished, I heard a ga-Zump!</p>
	<p>I looked.<br>
I saw something pop out of the stump<br>
of the tree I'd chopped down. It was sort of a man.<br>
Describe him?... That's hard. I don't know if I can.</p>

	<p>He was shortish. And oldish.<br>
And brownish. And mossy.<br>
And he spoke with a voice<br>
that was sharpish and bossy.</p>
	<p>"Mister!" he said with a sawdusty sneeze,<br>
"I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees.<br>
I speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues.<br>
And I'm asking you, sir, at the top if my lungs"-<br>
he was very upset as he shouted and puffed-<br>
"What's that THING you've made out of my Truffula tuft?"</p>
	<p>"Look, Lorax," I said."There's no cause for alarm.<br>
I chopped just one tree. I am doing no harm.<br>
I'm being quite useful. This thing is a Thneed.<br>
A Thneed's a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need!</p>
	<p>It's a shirt. It's a sock. It's a glove, It's a hat.<br>
But it has other uses. Yes, far beyond that.<br>
You can use it for carpets. For pillows! For sheets!<br>
Or curtains! Or covers for bicycle seats!"</p>
	<p>The Lorax said,<br>
"Sir! You are crazy with greed.<br>
There is no one on earth<br>
who would buy that fool Thneed!"</p>

	<p>But the very next minute I proved he was wrong.<br>
For, just at that minute, a chap came along,<br>
and he thought the Thneed I had knitted was great.</p>
	<p>He happily bought it for three ninety-eight<br>
I laughed at the Lorax, "You poor stupid guy!<br>
You never can tell what some people will buy."</p>
	<p>"I repeat," cried the Lorax,<br>
"I speak for the trees!"</p>
	<p>"I'm busy," I told him.<br>
"Shut up, if you please."</p>
	<p>I rushed 'cross the room, and in no time at all,<br>
built a radio-phone. I put in a quick call.<br>
I called all my brothers and uncles and aunts<br>
and I said, "Listen here! Here's a wonderful chance<br>
for the whole Once-ler Family to get mighty rich!<br>
Get over here fast! Take the road to North Nitch.<br>
Turn left at Weehawken. Sharp right at South Stitch."</p>
	<p>And, in no time at all,<br>
in the factory I built,<br>
the whole Once-ler Family<br>
was working full tilt.</p>
	<p>We were all knitting Thneeds<br>
just as busy as bees,<br>
to the sound of the chopping<br>
of Truffula Trees. </p>

	<p>Then...<br>
Oh! Baby! Oh!<br>
How my business did grow!<br>
Now, chopping one tree<br>
at a time<br>
was too slow.</p>
	<p>So I quickly invented my Super-Axe-Hacker<br>
which whacked off four Truffula Trees at one smacker.<br>
We were making Thneeds<br>
four times as fast as before!<br>
And that Lorax?...<br>
He didn't show up any more.</p>
	<p>But the next week<br>
he knocked<br>
on my new office door.</p>
	<p>He snapped, "I am the Lorax who speaks for the trees<br>
which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please.<br>
But I'm also in charge of the Brown Bar-ba-loots<br>
who played in the shade in their Bar-ba-loot suits<br>
and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits.</p>
	<p>"NOW... thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground,<br>
there's not enought Truffula Fruit to go 'round.<br>
And my poor Bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies<br>
because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies!</p>
	<p>"They loved living here. But I can't let them stay.<br>
They'll have to find food. And I hope that they may.<br>
Good luck, boys," he cried. And he sent them away.</p>
	<p>I, the old Once-ler, felt sad<br>
as I watched them all go.<br>
BUT...<br>
business is business!<br>
And business must grow<br>
regardless of crummies in tummies, you know.</p>

	<p>I meant no harm. I most truly did not.<br>
But I had to grow bigger. So bigger I got.</p>
	<p>I biggered my factory. I biggered my roads.<br>
I biggered my wagons. I biggered the loads<br>
of the Thneeds I shipped out. I was shipping them forth to the South! To the East! To the West! To the North!</p>
	<p>I went right on biggering... selling more Thneeds.<br>
And I biggered my money, which everyone needs.</p>
	<p>Then again he came back! I was fixing some pipes<br>
when that old-nuisance Lorax came back with more gripes.<br>
"I am the Lorax," he coughed and he whiffed.<br>
He sneezed and he snuffled. He snarggled. He sniffed.<br>
"Once-ler!" he cried with a cruffulous croak.<br>
"Once-ler! You're making such smogulous smoke!</p>
	<p>My poor Swomee-Swans... why, they can't sing a note!<br>
No one can sing who has smog in his throat.</p>
	<p>"And so," said the Lorax,<br>
"-please pardon my cough-<br>
they cannot live here.<br>
So I'm sending them off.</p>
	<p>"Where will they go?...<br>
I don't hopefully know.<br>
They may have to fly for a month... or a year...<br>
To escape from the smog you've smogged up around here.</p>

	<p>"What's more," snapped the Lorax. (His dander was up.)<br>
"Let me say a few words about Gluppity-Glupp.<br>
Your machine chugs on, day and night without stop<br>
making Gluppity-Glupp. Also Schloppity-Schlopp.<br>
And what do you do with this leftover goo?...<br>
I'll show you. You dirty old Once-ler man, you!</p>
	<p>"You're glumping the pond where the Humming-Fish hummed!<br>
No more can they hum, for their gills are all gummed.<br>
So I'm sending them off. Oh, their future is dreary.<br>
They'll walk on their fins and get woefully weary<br>
in search of some water that isn't so smeary."</p>
	<p>And then I got mad.<br>
I got terribly mad.<br>
I yelled at the Lorax, "Now listen here, Dad!<br>
All you do is yap-yap and say, 'Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!'<br>
Well, I have my rights, sir, and I'm telling you<br>
I intend to go on doing just what I do!<br>
And, for your information, you Lorax, I'm figgering<br>
On biggering<br>
and BIGGERING<br>
and BIGGERING<br>
and BIGGERING,<br>
turning MORE Truffula Trees into Thneeds<br>
which everyone, EVERYONE, EVERYONE needs!"</p>
	<p>And at that very moment, we heard a loud whack!<br>
From outside in the fields came a sickening smack<br>
of an axe on a tree. Then we heard the tree fall.<br>
The very last Truffula Tree of them all! </p>

	<p>No more trees. No more Thneeds. No more work to be done.<br>
So, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every one,<br>
all waved me good-bye. They jumped into my cars<br>
and drove away under the smoke-smuggered stars.</p>
	<p>Now all that was left 'neath the bad smelling-sky<br>
was my big empty factory...<br>
the Lorax...<br>
and I.</p>
	<p>The Lorax said nothing. Just gave me a glance...<br>
just gave me a very sad, sad backward glance...<br>
as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants.</p>
	<p>And I'll never forget the grim look on his face<br>
when he heisted himself and took leave of this place,<br>
through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace.<br>
And all that the Lorax left here in this mess<br>
was a small pile of rocks, with one word...</p>
	<p>"UNLESS."</p>
	<p>Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess.</p>

	<p>That was long, long ago.<br>
But each day since that day<br>
I've sat here and worried<br>
and worried away.</p>
	<p>Through the years, while my buildings<br>
have fallen apart,<br>
I've worried about it<br>
with all of my heart.</p>
	<p>"But now," says the Once-ler,<br>
"Now that you're here,<br>
the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear.<br>
UNLESS someone like you<br>
cares a whole awful lot,<br>
nothing is going to get better.<br>
It's not.</p>
	<p>"SO...<br>
Catch!" calls the Once-ler.<br>
He lets something fall.<br>
"It's a Truffula Seed.<br>
It's the last one of all!<br>
You're in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds.<br>
And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs.<br>
Plant a new Truffula.Treat it with care.<br>
Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air.<br>
Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 150px;">Then the Lorax<br>
and all of his friends<br>
may come back."</p>
